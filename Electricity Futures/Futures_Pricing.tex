\frame{
\frametitle{Pre-Liberalisation}
Liberalisation of the German electricity market started in April 1998\\
\bigskip
Before liberalisation: system based on calculatory costs, prices according to `cost-plus' rule
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integrated value-chain: production, grid, distribution
	\item Electricity production to secure supply within a regional monopole
	\item Long-term supply contracts
	\item No liquid market on the whole sale market
	\item Regulated consumer prices, regulated investments
\end{itemize}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
	\frametitle{Post-Liberalisation}
	System is market based: higher volatility of prices, flexibility\\
	\bigskip
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unbundling of value-chain
		\item Power plants are used optimally (no oblication to secure supply)
		\item New players and products
		\item Trading in Long- and Short-positions on a liquid whole sale market
		\item Investments based on market expectations
	\end{itemize}

\section{Classical Theory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
	\frametitle{Spot-Forward Relationship: classical theory}
	Under the no-arbitrage assumption we have the spot-forward relationship
	\begin{equation*}
	F(t,T) = S(t)\exp\{ (r-y)(T-t)\}
	\end{equation*}
	where $r$ is the interest rate at time $t$ for maturity $T$ and $y$ is the convenience yield (on holding inventories).
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
	\frametitle{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  In the stochastic model this means
			\begin{equation*}
		F(t,T) = \E_Q\{S(t) | \mathcal{F}_t\}
		\end{equation*}
		where $\mathcal{F}_t$ is the accumulated available market information (in most models the information generated by the spot price)
	\item $Q$ is the risk-neutral probability
	\begin{itemize}
		\item discounted spot price is a $Q$-martingale
		\item or the expected return under $Q$ is $r$
	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
	\frametitle{}
	We observe backwardation: Futures prices are below spot price
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Producers accept paying a premium for securing future production
		\item This may be caused by hedging pressure for long term investments
		\item Convenience yield larger than risk-free rate
	\end{itemize}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
	\frametitle{}
	Most models give either normal backwardation or contango
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  No stochastic change of sign (risk premium)
		\item True even for jump models
	\end{itemize}
}

%	The shape of commodities forward curves for different delivery periods indicates the market players' (producers, retailers and speculators) `attitudes' towards risk bearing in these markets\\
%	\bigskip
%	Contrast to equity: Here, if interest rates and dividends are assumed deterministic, simple no-arbitrage arguments are employed to show that the arbitrage-free forward price will be the cost of borrowing net of collected dividends yielded by the equity.

\item Delivery periods for Futures

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frame{
	\frametitle{}
	In electricity markets one typically observes that,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item for `long' dated forward contracts, markets are in backwardation (forward below spot)
		\item for `shorter' maturities the markets are in contango (forward above spot)
 	\end{itemize}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame[label=MPR]{
	\frametitle{Market Risk Premium}
The market risk premium or forward bias $\pi(t,T)$ relates forward and expected spot prices\\
\smallskip
It is defined as the difference, calculated at time $t$, between the forward $F(t, T)$ at time $t$ with delivery $T$ and expected spot price:
\begin{equation*}
\pi(t, T) = F(t, T) - \E^P\{S(T)| \mathcal{F}_t\}
\end{equation*}
Here $\E^P$ is the expectation operator, under the historical measure $P$, with information up until time $t$ and $S(T)$ is the spot price at time $T$\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two factor model feat. spikes and non-stationarity
		\item MPR shows typical change of sign depending on time to maturity
		\item At short end: positive MPR due to skewness in spot prices (Bessembinder \& Lemmon (2002))
		\item At long end (>2 months) negative MPR: Generators want to hedge uncertainty about future prices
	\end{itemize}
Open questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Goodness of fit of the stable CARMA model?
		\item Negative price spikes are not covered
		\item Effects drawn by renewables not considered
		\item Does new data give similar results?

		\item The cost function implied that the marginal production costs increase with output

		where $Q^D = \sum_{j=1}^{N_R} Q_{R_j}$ is total system demand. We see that when $c>2$ an increase in demand has a disproportionate effect on power prices

	We can approximate $P^{\frac{1}{c-1}}$ and $P^{\frac{c}{c-1}}$ using a Taylor series to see
	\begin{equation*}

	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item The downward bias in the forward price in the zero-skewness case reflects retailer's net hedging demand, who want to sell in the forward market
			\item The profits of power retailers are positively exposed, on average, because more retail power is sold when $P_W$ is high
			\item To reduce risk, retailers want to sell forwards
		\end{itemize}
		\item Typically we have skewness $(c>2)$,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item So $\gamma >0$ and the forward price increases with increasing skewness

	\begin{itemize}

		\item For instance, a large producer will generally be exposed to market uncertainty for a longer period of time, perhaps determined by the remaining life of the assets, whilst retailers will tend to make decisions based on a shorter time scale
		\item So the need for risk-diversification has a temporal dimension
	\end{itemize}

\frame{
	\frametitle{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item These differences in the desire to hedge positions are employed to explain the market risk premium and its sign 
		\item Retailers are less incentivised to contract commodity forwards the further out we look into the market
		\item In contrast, on the producers' side the need to hedge in the long-term does not fade away as quickly
	\end{itemize}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
	\frametitle{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We associate situations where $\pi(t, T)>0$ with the fact that retailers' desire to cover their positions `outweighs' those of the producers resulting in a positive market risk premium
		\item The mirror image is therefore one where the producers' desire to hedge their positions outweighs that of the retailers resulting in a negative market risk premium
